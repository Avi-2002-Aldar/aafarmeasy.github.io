        <b>Objective:</b>PM-KISAN is a government scheme in India aimed at

        in their agricultural expenses and livelihood. <br />
        <b>Beneficiaries: </b>The scheme targets farmers who own cultivable land
        up to 2 hectares, providing them with financial assistance.<br />
        <b>Financial Assistance:</b> Eligible farmers receive Rs. 6,000 per
        year, distributed in three equal installments of Rs. 2,000 each. <br />
        <b>Payment Method:</b> The financial aid is directly transferred to the
        beneficiaries' bank accounts through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)
        system.<br />
        <b>Application:</b> Farmers can apply for the scheme through the
        PM-KISAN portal or their state government's designated portal by
        providing personal and land-related details.<br />
        <b> Data Validation: </b>Stringent validation processes are in place to
        prevent duplicate entries and ensure that only eligible beneficiaries
        receive the assistance.<br />
        <b>Implementing Authority:</b> The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers
        Welfare, along with state governments and union territories, is
        responsible for implementing the scheme. <br />

        of India. Updates: The scheme has been updated and expanded over time to
        enhance payment efficiency and data management.<br />
