        <b>Objective:</b> The National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture aims
        to promote sustainable agricultural practices that enhance productivity,
        ensure resource efficiency, and strengthen the resilience of Indian
        agriculture to climate change.<br />
        <b>Focus Areas:</b> NMSA focuses on various components including soil
        health management, water-use efficiency, crop diversification, promotion
        of organic farming, and climate-resilient agricultural practices.<br />
        <b> Soil Health Management:</b> The mission emphasizes improving soil
        health through balanced nutrient management, adopting organic practices,
        and encouraging the use of organic and green manures.<br />
        <b>Water Use Efficiency:</b> NMSA aims to improve water-use efficiency
        by promoting efficient irrigation practices, micro-irrigation
        techniques, and water-saving technologies.<br />
        <b> Crop Diversification: </b>The mission encourages farmers to
        diversify their crop choices to reduce risks and enhance income
        stability. Crop diversification also contributes to better soil health
        and resource utilization.<br />
        <b>Organic Farming:</b> NMSA supports the adoption of organic farming
        practices, including the use of bio-fertilizers, bio-pesticides, and
        other eco-friendly inputs to reduce chemical dependency.<br />
        <b>Climate Resilient Agriculture:</b> The mission addresses the
        challenges posed by climate change by promoting climate-resilient
        agricultural practices.This includes the use of drought-resistant
        varieties, conservation agriculture, and agroforestry.<br />
        <b>Implementation:</b>
        NMSA is implemented through various central and state agencies, with
        coordination at both levels to ensure effective execution of sustainable
        agriculture practices.<br />
        <b>Training and Capacity Building:</b>
        The mission focuses on training and capacity building of farmers to
        adopt new practices and technologies related to sustainable
        agriculture.<br />
        <b>Funding:</b>
        NMSA receives funding from the Government of India and is a part of the
        National Action Plan on Climate Change.
