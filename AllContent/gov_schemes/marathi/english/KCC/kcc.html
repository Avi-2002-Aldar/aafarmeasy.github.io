        <b>Purpose:</b> The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) is a government scheme in
        India that aims to provide timely and affordable credit to farmers to
        meet their agricultural needs, including cultivation expenses,
        post-harvest costs, and working capital requirements.<br />
        <b>Eligibility:</b> All farmers, including small and marginal farmers,
        tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and self-help groups, are eligible to
        apply for a Kisan Credit Card.<br />
        <b>Financial Support: </b>KCC provides access to credit facilities based
        on the farmer's credit requirements, which are determined by the scale
        of farming, cropping pattern, and other factors. It provides a revolving
        credit line that can be used multiple times within the validity
        period.<br />
        <b>Features:</b> KCC acts as a single-window credit facility,
        incorporating crop loans, consumption loans, and term loans for
        agriculture-related purposes. It helps simplify credit access and reduce
        the need for multiple loan applications.<br />
        <b>Validity:</b> The KCC has a validity period, usually of up to five
        years, which can be renewed upon review and assessment. <br />
        <b>Credit Limit:</b> The credit limit under the KCC is determined based
        on the farmer's cropping pattern and the scale of operations. It helps
        ensure that farmers have access to sufficient credit for their
        agricultural activities. <br />
        <b>Interest Rates:</b> The interest rates for KCC loans are typically
        lower compared to other forms of credit, making it more affordable for
        farmers.<br />
        <b> Flexibility:</b> Farmers can choose the timing and amount of
        withdrawal within the credit limit, providing flexibility based on their
        actual needs.<br />
        <b> Repayment:</b> KCC loans are generally structured with flexible
        repayment options, allowing farmers to repay the loan after the sale of
        their crops. <br />
        <b>Implementation:</b> KCC is implemented by various banks and financial
        institutions in coordination with the National Bank for Agriculture and
        Rural Development (NABARD).<br />
        <b>Subsidy:</b> In some cases, farmers may also be eligible for interest
        rate subsidies and other incentives, depending on the government's
        policy and the farmer's credit history. <br />
        <b>Insurance Coverage:</b> Many KCCs come with insurance coverage,
        providing financial protection to farmers in case of crop failure,
        accidents, or other unforeseen events.
